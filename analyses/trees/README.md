# Directory contents

This directory contains trees built from the latest multiple protein alignments. These trees included best aligned exonerate results against _C hookeri_ and _M extradentata_ whole genome assemblies using _D melanogaster_ `Eip74EF`, `en` and `Ubx` genes. The trees were built with [FastTree](http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/) v. 2.1.10.
